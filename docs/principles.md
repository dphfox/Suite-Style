## There isn't one true way to write code

... but there can be one consistent way. Suite Style optimises for consistency
rather than perfection, so we can get to work.

## Code is written once

... but it is read and understood repeatedly by different people. Code is taken out of context for code reviews, viewed
in various editors and viewing conditions, and interpreted by people with different experience and knowledge. Reducing 
effort for many readers saves more time than reducing effort for one or two writers.

## Code needs to be understandable first

... then low-tech, and then concise, in that order of importance. Complexity above basic levels is either justified or
removed. The dumb solution is the solution most broadly understood. Understanding is lost easily over time; what is not
penned is considered lost.
